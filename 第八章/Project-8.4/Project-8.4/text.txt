The specific content of this design is the new intelligent wheelchair based on brainwave technology. The service users are mainly those who are permanently incapacitated due to traffic accidents or diseases. However, most of the transportation tools on the market require manual manipulation by users, which makes it impossible for those people who cannot move or cannot move to travel alone.  So there is an urgent need for a product based on new control technology to facilitate these groups. This design is developed for this purpose.
